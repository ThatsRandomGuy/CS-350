# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to create a basic thermostat that was capable of cooling and heating depending on the current room temperature and the set temperature. Heating was represented with a red LED and cooling was represented with a blue LED.

What did you do particularly well?
Something I would say I did particularly well was integrating hardware with software. I have worked with Raspberry Pis a lot in the past and this was nothing I was not already familiar with. Seeing the hardware actually react to something you code is truly something special!

Where could you improve?
I think I could improve on my understanding of LCD screens. I was able to complete this project without too many issues, but I still do not completely understand how they work. They use multiple GPIO pins as well which I do not completely understand.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
There were not many tools and resources I used that were different than what I normally use. The first tool I like to use is the given resources. This includes the textbook and other articles provided for the module we are working on. If I run into errors, I like to use Stack Overflow. There are multiple solutions to every problem and Stack Overflow knows them all it seems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Being able to use something like a Raspberry Pi is very useful in my eyes. I can see a lot of uses for this type of programming, and I will definitely use this in my future projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to keep code maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is important to use the industry best practices. This way other developers will be able to understand what work you have done, and they can easily make changes. By using things like in-line comments, other developers can see how you are using the code to get specific operations done.
